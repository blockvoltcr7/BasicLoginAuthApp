# Password Reset Feature Requirements

## Overview
The password reset feature will allow users who have forgotten their passwords to securely reset them through an email-based verification process. This feature will leverage the existing magic link email functionality and extend the authentication system.

## User Flow
1. User navigates to the login page
2. User clicks "Forgot Password" link
3. User enters their email address
4. System sends a password reset link to the user's email
5. User clicks the link in the email
6. User is directed to a password reset form
7. User enters and confirms a new password
8. System validates and updates the password
9. User is redirected to login with their new password

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Components
1. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/forgot-password`: Accepts an email address and sends a reset link
   - `GET /api/reset-password`: Validates the reset token from the email link
   - `POST /api/reset-password`: Accepts a new password and updates the user record

2. **Database Changes**
   - Add password reset tokens to the database schema
   - Add token expiration timestamps

3. **Security Considerations**
   - One-time use tokens that expire after a set time (1 hour)
   - Validate token ownership before allowing password reset
   - Implement rate limiting for password reset requests
   - Require password complexity validation

### Frontend Components
1. **New Pages/Components**
   - Forgot Password form
   - Password Reset form

2. **UI/UX Requirements**
   - Clear error messages for invalid inputs
   - Success confirmations at each step
   - Password strength indicator
   - Mobile-responsive design matching existing UI

## Integration Points
- Leverage existing email sending functionality
- Use current authentication system for validation
- Integrate with existing user database

## Constraints
- Token must expire after 1 hour for security
- Users must set a password that meets minimum complexity requirements
- Email notifications must be sent in a timely manner
