## Epic: Implement Password Reset Functionality

**Description**: Add the ability for users to reset their password securely when they've forgotten it.

**Business Value**: Improves user experience by providing a self-service way to regain access to accounts, reducing support tickets and user frustration.

## User Stories

### 1. Forgot Password Request
**As a** user who has forgotten my password,  
**I want to** request a password reset link,  
**So that** I can securely reset my password.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- A "Forgot Password" link is visible on the login form
- Clicking the link shows a form to enter my email address
- After submitting a valid email, I receive a confirmation message
- The system sends a password reset email to my address

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add password reset token schema to database
- [ ] Create forgot password API endpoint
- [ ] Implement token generation and storage
- [ ] Add email template for password reset
- [ ] Create forgot password UI component
- [ ] Add form validation for email input
- [ ] Implement API integration from frontend
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 2. Password Reset Form
**As a** user with a password reset link,  
**I want to** set a new password,  
**So that** I can regain access to my account.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Clicking the link in the email takes me to a password reset form
- I can enter and confirm a new password
- The form validates that my passwords match and meet complexity requirements
- I receive feedback if my passwords don't match or are too weak
- After successfully setting a password, I'm redirected to the login page

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create password reset page with form
- [ ] Implement token validation in backend
- [ ] Create password reset API endpoint
- [ ] Add password complexity validation
- [ ] Implement password update logic
- [ ] Add success/error notifications
- [ ] Update router to handle password reset routes
- [ ] Add tests for password reset flow

### 3. Security Enhancements
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** the password reset process to be secure,  
**So that** user accounts cannot be compromised.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour
- Tokens can only be used once
- The system doesn't reveal whether an email exists in the database
- Failed reset attempts are logged

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement token expiration logic
- [ ] Add one-time-use flag to tokens
- [ ] Ensure consistent responses regardless of email existence
- [ ] Add logging for security events
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection for forms
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for security measures
