# Sprint 1: Google OAuth Setup and Configuration

## Task 1: Create Google Cloud Project and OAuth Credentials

### Description
Set up a new Google Cloud Platform project and create OAuth 2.0 client credentials that will be used for Google authentication in our application.

### Implementation Details
1. Access the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project named "[AppName]-Auth"
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Configure OAuth consent screen:
   - Set user type to "External"
   - Add application name, user support email, and developer contact information
   - Add scopes for email and profile information
5. Create OAuth client ID:
   - Select "Web application" as the application type
   - Add authorized JavaScript origins: `https://[your-replit-domain]`
   - Add authorized redirect URIs: `https://[your-replit-domain]/api/auth/google/callback`
6. Download the JSON file containing OAuth credentials

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Google Cloud project is created
- [ ] OAuth consent screen is configured
- [ ] OAuth client ID is generated
- [ ] Credentials JSON file is downloaded and available for integration

### Test Cases
- Verify that the Google Cloud project is created successfully
- Confirm that OAuth client ID appears in the credentials list
- Validate that redirect URIs are correctly configured

## Task 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

### Description
Set up the OAuth consent screen with appropriate application information, permissions, and test users to ensure a smooth authentication experience.

### Implementation Details
1. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
2. Configure the following information:
   - App name: [Application Name]
   - User support email
   - Application homepage link
   - Application privacy policy link
   - Application terms of service link
3. Add required API scopes:
   - `openid`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile`
4. Add test users (emails) for development testing
5. Review and submit for verification

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OAuth consent screen is configured with correct application information
- [ ] All required API scopes are added
- [ ] Test users are added for development testing
- [ ] Consent screen is submitted for verification (if publishing)

### Test Cases
- Verify that OAuth consent screen shows correct application information
- Confirm that all required scopes are included
- Validate that test users can access the application during development

## Task 3: Store Google OAuth Credentials Securely

### Description
Securely store the Google OAuth credentials in the application environment to ensure they are accessible for authentication but protected from unauthorized access.

### Implementation Details
1. Create a new secret in Replit's Secrets tool:
   - Name: `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
   - Value: Client ID from credentials JSON file
2. Create another secret:
   - Name: `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - Value: Client secret from credentials JSON file
3. Create a third secret:
   - Name: `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`
   - Value: `https://[your-replit-domain]/api/auth/google/callback`
4. Update server configuration to load these secrets from environment variables

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OAuth credentials are stored as environment secrets
- [ ] Credentials are not exposed in code or repositories
- [ ] Server configuration loads credentials from environment variables
- [ ] Secrets are accessible in the application for authentication

### Test Cases
- Verify that credentials are stored in Replit's Secrets tool
- Confirm that server can access the stored credentials
- Validate that credentials are not exposed in code repositories

## Task 4: Update Database Schema for Google Authentication

### Description
Extend the existing user model and database schema to support Google authentication by adding fields for Google ID, profile information, and authentication type.

### Implementation Details
1. Update the user schema to include:
   - `googleId`: A unique identifier from Google
   - `authType`: An enum to distinguish between different authentication methods
   - `profilePictureUrl`: URL to user's Google profile picture
2. Create a migration script to update the database schema
3. Update user model types and interfaces to reflect schema changes
4. Ensure existing functionality works with updated schema

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User schema is updated with Google authentication fields
- [ ] Migration script successfully updates existing database
- [ ] User model types are updated to reflect schema changes
- [ ] Existing authentication flows continue to work with updated schema

### Test Cases
- Run migration and verify schema changes in database
- Create a new user with Google authentication fields
- Verify that existing users still work with the updated schema
- Test database queries using the updated schema
