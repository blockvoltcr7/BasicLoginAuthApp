# Sprint 4: Testing and Security

## Task 1: Test All Google Authentication Flows

### Description
Thoroughly test all Google authentication flows to ensure they work correctly and handle edge cases appropriately.

### Implementation Details
1. Create comprehensive test suite for Google authentication:
   - Unit tests for authentication functions
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for complete authentication flows
2. Test specific scenarios:
   - New user registration with Google
   - Returning user login with Google
   - Account linking for existing users
   - Authentication failures and error handling
3. Implement test mocks for Google OAuth responses
4. Create test coverage report

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All Google authentication flows are covered by tests
- [ ] Tests verify both success and failure scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases are properly tested
- [ ] Test coverage reaches at least 80% for authentication code

### Test Cases
- Test new user registration flow
- Test returning user authentication
- Test account linking and unlinking
- Verify error handling for various failure scenarios

## Task 2: Implement Security Measures for OAuth Token Handling

### Description
Enhance security for handling OAuth tokens to protect user accounts and prevent unauthorized access.

### Implementation Details
1. Implement secure token storage:
   - Store tokens server-side in secure session
   - Never expose tokens in client-side code
   - Encrypt sensitive token data at rest
2. Implement token validation:
   - Verify token signature and expiration
   - Validate token scopes
   - Check for token revocation
3. Add token refresh mechanism:
   - Handle expired tokens
   - Implement graceful re-authentication
4. Implement CSRF protection for OAuth flows

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OAuth tokens are securely stored
- [ ] Tokens are properly validated before use
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism works correctly
- [ ] CSRF protection is implemented for OAuth flows

### Test Cases
- Verify secure token storage
- Test token validation with valid and invalid tokens
- Test token refresh mechanism
- Verify CSRF protection prevents attacks

## Task 3: Add Logging and Monitoring for Authentication Events

### Description
Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for Google authentication events to track usage, detect issues, and identify potential security threats.

### Implementation Details
1. Add structured logging for authentication events:
   - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
   - Account creation
   - Account linking/unlinking
   - Session management events
2. Implement monitoring dashboards:
   - Track authentication success/failure rates
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Alert on suspicious activity
3. Create audit trail for security-sensitive operations
4. Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information (PII)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Authentication events are logged with appropriate detail
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive personal information
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard provides visibility into authentication patterns
- [ ] Audit trail captures security-sensitive operations

### Test Cases
- Verify logging of successful authentication
- Verify logging of failed authentication
- Test monitoring dashboard with simulated data
- Verify PII is properly redacted from logs

## Task 4: Perform Security Review and Vulnerability Testing

### Description
Conduct a comprehensive security review and vulnerability testing of the Google authentication implementation to identify and address potential security issues.

### Implementation Details
1. Perform code review focused on security:
   - Check for proper input validation
   - Verify token handling security
   - Review error handling for information leakage
   - Check for secure communications
2. Conduct vulnerability testing:
   - Test for common OAuth vulnerabilities
   - Attempt authentication bypasses
   - Check for information disclosure
   - Test session management security
3. Create security report documenting findings
4. Address identified vulnerabilities

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Security code review is completed
- [ ] Vulnerability testing is performed
- [ ] Security report is created documenting findings
- [ ] All identified vulnerabilities are addressed

### Test Cases
- Attempt authentication bypass attacks
- Test for CSRF vulnerabilities
- Check for token leakage
- Verify session fixation protection
