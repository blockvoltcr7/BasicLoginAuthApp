# Sprint 3: Frontend Implementation

## Task 1: Add Google Sign-in Button to Authentication Forms

### Description
Integrate Google sign-in buttons into the login and registration forms to provide users with the option to authenticate using their Google accounts.

### Implementation Details
1. Create a reusable Google sign-in button component:
   - Follow Google's branding guidelines for the button
   - Include proper text and Google logo
   - Add appropriate styling for different states (default, hover, focus)
2. Add the button to login form:
   - Position below traditional login form
   - Add divider with "or" text between traditional and Google login
3. Add the button to registration form:
   - Position below traditional registration form
   - Add appropriate contextual text
4. Ensure responsive design on all screen sizes

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Google sign-in button follows Google's branding guidelines
- [ ] Button is present on both login and registration forms
- [ ] Button is visually distinct from traditional authentication options
- [ ] Button is responsive and works on all screen sizes

### Test Cases
- Verify button appearance on login page
- Verify button appearance on registration page
- Test responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Verify button states (hover, focus, active)

## Task 2: Implement Authentication Flow on the Client Side

### Description
Implement the client-side flow for Google authentication, including initiating the OAuth process and handling the authentication response.

### Implementation Details
1. Create authentication service functions:
   - `initiateGoogleAuth()`: Redirects to Google authentication endpoint
   - `handleGoogleAuthCallback()`: Processes the callback response
2. Update authentication context/store:
   - Add Google authentication state
   - Handle Google-specific authentication flow
3. Implement click handler for Google sign-in button:
   - Initiate Google authentication flow
   - Show loading state during authentication
4. Add proper error handling for authentication failures

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking Google sign-in button initiates authentication flow
- [ ] Authentication process shows appropriate loading states
- [ ] Successful authentication updates user context/store
- [ ] Authentication errors are properly handled and displayed

### Test Cases
- Test initiating Google authentication
- Verify loading state during authentication
- Test successful authentication flow
- Verify error handling with simulated authentication failures

## Task 3: Handle Authentication Redirects and State Management

### Description
Implement robust handling of OAuth redirects and manage authentication state throughout the redirect flow to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Implementation Details
1. Implement redirect handling:
   - Capture redirect from Google OAuth provider
   - Extract authentication tokens and state
   - Validate state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks
2. Update route protection for authenticated routes:
   - Recognize Google-authenticated sessions
   - Apply same access control rules
3. Implement authentication persistence:
   - Store authentication state in localStorage/sessionStorage
   - Restore state after page reload
4. Add logic to handle authentication expiration

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application correctly handles redirects from Google
- [ ] Authentication state is preserved through the redirect flow
- [ ] State parameter is validated to prevent CSRF attacks
- [ ] Authentication persists across page reloads

### Test Cases
- Test full authentication flow with redirects
- Verify state validation prevents CSRF attacks
- Test authentication persistence after page reload
- Verify handling of expired authentication

## Task 4: Create Account Linking Interface for Existing Users

### Description
Develop an interface allowing existing users to link their accounts with Google to enable seamless Google sign-in for future sessions.

### Implementation Details
1. Create account linking section in user profile/settings:
   - Show current linked authentication methods
   - Provide button to link Google account
   - Show unlinking option for linked accounts
2. Implement linking flow:
   - Initiate Google OAuth flow with appropriate scopes
   - Handle callback and account association
   - Show success/error feedback
3. Implement unlinking functionality:
   - Add confirmation dialog
   - Implement API call to remove Google ID
   - Update UI to reflect changes
4. Add appropriate validation and error handling

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Account linking interface is accessible in user settings
- [ ] Users can link their Google accounts to existing accounts
- [ ] Users can unlink Google accounts if alternative authentication exists
- [ ] Success and error states are clearly communicated

### Test Cases
- Test linking Google account to existing account
- Verify linked account appears in user settings
- Test unlinking Google account
- Verify error handling for linking failures
