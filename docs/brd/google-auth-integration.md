# Business Requirements Document: Google Authentication Integration

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for integrating Google authentication into our existing authentication system. This feature will allow users to sign in using their Google accounts, providing a streamlined authentication experience while maintaining security standards.

## 2. Business Objectives

- Enhance user experience by providing a familiar and trusted authentication method
- Increase user registration and retention rates by simplifying the sign-up process
- Reduce friction in the authentication flow
- Maintain security standards while expanding authentication options

## 3. Current System

The application currently supports:
- Username/password authentication
- Magic link email authentication
- Password reset functionality

The authentication system is built using:
- Express.js for backend API endpoints
- Passport.js for authentication middleware
- React for frontend components
- Shadcn UI components for the user interface

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

1. **Google OAuth Integration**
   - Users must be able to sign in using their Google accounts
   - System must request appropriate scopes (email, profile)
   - First-time Google sign-ins should create new user accounts
   - Returning Google users should be authenticated to existing accounts

2. **Account Linking**
   - Users with existing accounts should be able to link their Google accounts
   - System should prevent duplicate accounts by matching email addresses

3. **User Experience**
   - Google sign-in option must be prominently displayed on login/register forms
   - Sign-in process should require minimal clicks
   - Clear feedback must be provided during the authentication process

4. **Security**
   - OAuth tokens must be securely handled
   - User permissions must be properly scoped
   - Session management should remain consistent with existing auth flow

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Google authentication flow should complete within 5 seconds
   - Integration should not impact existing authentication methods

2. **Compatibility**
   - Solution must work across all modern browsers
   - Mobile responsiveness must be maintained

3. **Compliance**
   - Solution must comply with Google OAuth requirements
   - User data handling must comply with privacy regulations

## 5. Technical Implementation

### 5.1 Dependencies

- Passport Google OAuth 2.0 strategy
- Google API credentials

### 5.2 Backend Changes

1. **OAuth Configuration**
   - Set up Google Developer Console project
   - Configure OAuth consent screen
   - Generate client ID and client secret

2. **Passport Strategy Implementation**
   - Implement Google OAuth 2.0 strategy with Passport.js
   - Create API endpoints for Google authentication flow
   - Implement user creation/linking logic

3. **User Model Updates**
   - Add Google ID field to user model
   - Implement methods to find users by Google ID

### 5.3 Frontend Changes

1. **UI Components**
   - Add Google sign-in button to login and registration forms
   - Create account linking interface in user settings

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Implement client-side Google authentication flow
   - Handle authentication redirects and state

## 6. Integration Points

- Existing authentication system (auth.ts)
- User model/database schema
- Login/registration UI components

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Google API changes | Stay updated with Google Developer news and implement changes promptly |
| Duplicate accounts | Implement email matching to prevent duplicate accounts |
| OAuth token security | Follow security best practices for token storage and transmission |
| User confusion | Provide clear UI guidance and documentation |

## 8. Success Metrics

- Percentage of users choosing Google authentication
- Reduction in failed login attempts
- User satisfaction with authentication process
- Conversion rate from visitor to registered user

## 9. Timeline and Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Backend Implementation (1 week)
- Configure Google Developer Console
- Implement Passport Google strategy
- Create necessary API endpoints

### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation (1 week)
- Add Google authentication UI components
- Implement client-side authentication flow
- Create account linking interface

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (1 week)
- Test all authentication flows
- Gather user feedback
- Make refinements based on testing

### Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring (Ongoing)
- Deploy to production
- Monitor usage and performance
- Address issues as they arise

## 10. Approval and Stakeholders

- **Project Manager**: Responsible for overall project timeline and coordination
- **Frontend Developer**: Responsible for UI implementation
- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for API and integration implementation
- **Security Team**: Responsible for security review and approval
- **UX Designer**: Responsible for authentication flow design
